# Dual Output Regulated Power Supply (230V AC to 12V & 9V DC)

This project demonstrates a dual-output regulated power supply using 7812 and 7809 voltage regulators.  
Input 230V AC is stepped down, rectified, filtered, and regulated to provide stable 12V and 9V DC outputs.

Components used:
- Step-down transformer
- Bridge rectifier
- Filter capacitors
- IC 7812 (12V regulator)
- IC 7809 (9V regulator)

Designed and simulated in Proteus.
